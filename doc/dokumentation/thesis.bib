abstract = {Abstract A novel quasi-continuous on-line measuring technique for shaken microtiter plates is presented. Light scattering as well as intracellular and/or protein fluorescence (e.g. NADH, YFP) is measured during the shaking procedure, thus allowing a process monitoring of 96 different simultaneous cultures in a microtiter plate. In contrast to existing measurement techniques, the shaking process does not have to be stopped to take the measurements, thus avoiding the corresponding interruption of the cultures' oxygen supply and any unpredictable effects on the cultures. Experiments were conducted with E. coli in LB, TB, and MOPS minimal medium and V. natriegens in modified LB and TB media. Intensity curves of scattered light and NADH fluorescence were used to distinguish different lag phases, growth velocities, or inoculation densities. Data from this new method corresponded well to the off-line measured optical densities and to the oxygen transfer rates of cultures run in simultaneously conducted shake flask experiments at equivalent oxygen transfer capacities. With the aid of yellow fluorescence protein fused to interleukin-6 the optimal induction time of an expressing E. coli strain could be determined by on-line monitoring of product formation. Thus, this measuring technique enables the researcher to evaluate and to discriminate different cultures on a screening level and to improve screening conditions, process development and scale-up. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

abstract = {Abstract Small-scale high-throughput screening devices are becoming increasingly important in bioprocess development. Conventional dipping probes for process monitoring are often too large to be used in these devices. Thus, optical measurements are often the method of choice. Even some parameters that cannot directly be measured by fluorescence become accessible via sensitive fluorescence dyes. However, not all compounds of interest are measurable by this technique. Recent studies applying multi-wavelength (2D) fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics have shown that information on numerous analytes is obscured by the fluorescence data. Hitherto, this measurement technique has only been available on the scale of stirred tank fermenters. This work introduces a new device for multi-wavelength (2D) fluorescence spectroscopy in each well of a continuously shaken microtiter plate. Using a combination of spectrograph and CCD detector, the required time per measurement cycle in a 48-well microtiter plate was 0.5 h. Cultures of Hansenula polymorpha and Escherichia coli are monitored. The concentrations of glycerol, glucose and acetate as well as pH are determined using partial least square (PLS) models. Because a pH-sensitive fluorescence dye was not required, no dependency of the pKa of a fluorescence dye exists, and measurements in the low pH range can be obtained.}

abstract = {Abstract In microtiter plates, conventional online monitoring of biomass concentration based on optical measurements is limited to transparent media: It also cannot differentiate between dead or viable biomass or suspended particles. To address this limitation, this study introduces and validates a new online monitoring setup based on impedance spectroscopy for detecting only viable biomass in 48- and 96-well microtiter plates. The setup was first validated electronically and characterized by determining the cell constants of the measuring geometry. Defined cell suspensions of Ustilago maydis, Hansenula polymorpha, Escherichia coli and Bacillus licheniformis were characterized to find, among other parameters, the most suitable frequency range and the characteristic frequency of β-dispersion for each organism. Finally, the setup was exemplarily applied to monitor the growth of Hansenula polymorpha online. As reference, three different parallel cultures were performed in established cultivation systems. This new online monitoring setup based on impedance spectroscopy is robust and enables precise measurements of microbial biomass concentration. It is promising for future high-throughput applications.}
